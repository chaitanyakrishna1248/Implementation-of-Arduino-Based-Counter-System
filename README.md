# Implementation-of-Arduino-Based-Counter-System
My first project which was converted into a paper. I designed a modified counter system which can allow multiple persons at a time . The system consists of piezo sensors and IR sensors to detect people walking in front of them.

Drawback: The system was heavily tested and regularized based on the observations (weight of the person, frequency of people). It might vary in large scale implementation. Piezo sensors must be replaced on regular basis as they wear out quickly.
